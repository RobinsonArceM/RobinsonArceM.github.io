## About Me  
My journey combines deep scientific investigation with cutting-edge data science. Holding a PhD in Cellular and Molecular Biology, I developed expertise in areas like fluorescence microscopy and energy metabolism. This rigorous research foundation now fuels my work as a Data Scientist.

**Transition & Experience:** Gained practical experience applying Python, AI, and machine learning in a startup environment, focusing on the development of a model that allows to predict the optimal combination of organic waste to feed Black Soldier Fly larvae and produce high quality protein for animal feed.<br>
<br>
**Technical Skills:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit), Machine Learning, Data Analysis & Visualization, AI Implementation, Google Colab, Biopython, Alphafold and Pymol.<br>
<br>
**Scientific Expertise:** Biochemistry, Cellular/Molecular Biology, Fluorescence Microscopy, Energy Metabolism, Fluorescent Nanosensors, Mathematical modelling.<br>
<br>
**Current Focus Areas:** <br>
- Applying AI and predictive modeling for sustainable development.
- Developing custom data processing and insight generation pipelines.
- Seeking opportunities where I can leverage both my scientific background and data science skills.
